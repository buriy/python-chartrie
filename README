CharTrie
=============

This is pure-C version of Trie data structure: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie , 
also called "prefix tree", optimized for string keys and int values.

The current interface is the following::

    class CharTrie:
        def __len__(self): pass
        def __getitem__(self, key): pass
        def __setitem__(self, key, value): pass
        def dumps(self): pass
        def debug_print(self): pass
        def find(self, key): pass

    class FrozenCharTrie:
        def __len__(self): pass
        def __getitem__(self, key): pass
        def loads(self, stream): pass
        def debug_print(self): pass
        def find(self, key): pass

Please note, that len(x) returns the number of chars in the trie, not the number of nodes with values.
Also, only values >= 0 are supported (until version 0.2)
